_____________Developing a Criminal Face Detection System________________

In this project, you will develop a system that can detect faces from security camera images and identify potential criminals based on an existing database of known offenders. This project will require knowledge of computer vision techniques, data structures for image processing, and machine learning algorithms.

Some features you may include in your criminal face detection system are:

Face recognition and matching using deep learning models

Regular updates to the criminal database through scraping or manual input.
